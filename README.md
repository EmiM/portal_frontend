# Requirements

This project is developed for Python 3.5.3 (or newer). 

# Installation

## Backend

The steps are:

1. Clone this repo
1. cd to repo (with `manage.py` file)
1. Create virtualenv with virtualenvwrapper: `mkvirtualenv portal`
1. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Create file `fabric_config.py` with contents (adjust if something is different in your config):

    ```python
    import os
    
    from fabric.decorators import task
    from fabric.utils import _AttributeDict


    class DevelConfig(_AttributeDict):
        def __init__(self):
            self.local = True
            self.environment = 'devel'
            self.domain = 'localhost'
            self.env_path = '~/.virtualenvs/portal'

            self.project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
            self.DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = 'settings.{environment}'.format(**self)
    
            
    @task
    def devel():
        env.update(DevelConfig())

    ```

1. Bootstrap app with `fab devel bootstrap`

If you already have virtualenv created previously simply enter it before starting server: `workon portal`

1. Run server with `fab devel runserver`
1. Open in the browser `localhost:8000`

### Testing

You can run pytest tests with:

`fab devel test` or simply `pytest` as well.

## Frontend

1. Clone this repo if not cloned yet
1. Enter repo dir and inside the `front` dir 
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run start`
1. The browser will start page automatically (`localhost:3000`)

Build with `npm run build` - it will move static and template files to proper directories.
